## Almanac

#### Intro
Shows today's feasts. Only Greek namedays are included for now.

#### About
I started this small project to practice my rusted C skills.

This is nearly a fork of a well-known application with greek namedays, I will try to expand.

#### How-to
Compile with:

```
gcc -o almanac -O2 -pedantic almanac.c
```

Run with:

```
./almanac
```
